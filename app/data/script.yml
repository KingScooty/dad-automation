  I enjoyed learning about the Mayans because I know know were chocolate was invented; however thats not the only reason. Learning about the Mayans has helped me understand the old fashion of life. It's Important that we know about the Mayans because they invented marvelous creations that some of we still use and benefit from today. The Mayans are an intresting subject and I highly recomend it to many humans who like history. This is amazing and I would definately do it again.

  Mrs Lavander - the year six teacher - sat proudly in her large leather chair. She smiled as the children came in and sat down at their desks. She took a sip of her coffee and looked down at her laptop, she scanned the register. It was class presentation day and the students were going to recite what they had discovered on the homework topic of The Mayans. She lifted her hand as if it was Harry Potters wand and slowly took aim then pointed her finger at Jenny. "Jenny" Mrs lavender softly. She was the victim!

  Jenny trotted up to the front of the class and plugged her pen drive into Mrs lavander's Samsung laptop. Suddenly, the interactive white board burst into life. The Mayans weren't always wealthy. When they started of they lived in small villages, however they still managed to find precious gems and ores! Before they grew larger they used their resorces to build wooden houses with straw thatched roofs. Many villages were located near a river/lake. This was so they had water for fish and to drink and to fertilize the land.

  Jenny turned back at the laptop and left clicked to slip on to the next slide. Later on the Mayans created pyramids, they did this with: large stone bricks, possibly limestone and other strong constructive blocks. The civilized citys used these marvelous pyramids for worshipping their many Gods. At the top they had a small shelter used for making sacrifices. They painted the pyramids but with what? Paint made from unknown foods or flowers. Many believe that the Mayans copied the pyraids from the Egyptians who lived before.

  Yet again, young Jenny lightly taped the left mouse button and filled her mind with the points for the next slide. These civilized towns grew from poor tribes of 20 to citys of millions! Life for the Mayans was extremely good, they had: pyramids, used for sacrifices; jewellry, used to look more bueatiful; they had chocolate, the best of their delicious creations. They also thaught that squint eyes -so parents dangled thread on babys noses to make it stay- and big noses were also seen as attractive! Their life was great; however different from todays usual lifestyle.

  Again, Jenny turned her back to the class to swiftly move along. After being happy and setled they got attaked by the spanish-who stole their jewellry and chocolate- who drove them out. The Mayans often got raided but not like this. Many tribes/nations found time to attak the mexican citys of Maya. raiding was comon because other citys were jealous of their wealth and fortune. Yet did they know it would happen many of a time. It was so normal for them; however they never enjoyed a rading, it was always an upsetting and dissapointing event fo the Mayans.

7: >
  For the fith time Jenny clicked to move along. The tribes found guilt and returned back to Maya after hiding from the roaring citys rading. They held ceremonys. (To their gods to be forgiven.) So with the Mayans back everything returned to the happy life.They made more chocolate and sacrifices to their Gods. They let blood to sacrifice... and let the life return. The Mayan life returned. The desises they contracted because of no medicine; however they were happy with their life style and situation.

  Jenny-who was the child giving the presentation- looked back to move along again. The Mayans abandoned their land due to the lack of supplies. As time went on everything began to become over grown! The huts and the pyramids began to gather dust. This ment they were no longer  happy... As they abandoned they city dissapeared. The elements took in the temples and pyramids. The lack of resources really made a difference. It made a whole city abandone their home and home land.

  Jenny spun around and clicked 3 times to jump along. The city of Maya became a rainforest. It was lost and forgotten. So, it was called The lost city of Maya. The temples and huts were coverd in moss and nature. The trees covered the temples and pyramids. All was left was the ruins. There was in no way a sign of Mayan life. The magnificent life to overgrown rainforests... All that was left was the elemental nature. The birds adapted it and and made homes around. It was for certain the life had dissapeared into the wildernes. No Mayan in sight.

10: >
  One more time Jenny's feet turned to face Mrs Lavenders desk for the next slide to appear.  With the Mayans gone the Spanish invaded. They began to rebuild Maya, the temples, the huts and even the pyramids. The rainforrest began to dissapear as repairing ocured. Construction returned as well as life; however not Mayan life. Spanish life, they took what they could but the Mayans returned to their home land. They were not free to own the land. he mayans becme slaves and were forced to rebuild their city, so the Spanish could steal their goods.

11: >
  For the last time Jenny's small, soft hand touched the mouse. The Mayans returned. When? Why? They couldn't stand the thought of Spain rulling their land they returned! The citys grew, Maya grew and the joy inside the city grew. As the rebuilding came. The production of construction returned. This is the Mayan life. As  the citys grew,  happines came! Life in Mayan Citys eventualy returned. (After hard work and a lot of effort ofcourse.) Now many can visit their as tourists; however Blue Maya and other city's haven't been found!

  Jenny turned her body towards the laptop and unplugged the pen drive. She skipped down to the back as her astonished class mates roared with applause "Thankyou,  Jenny  smile as she knew Mrs Lavender was giving her the smile of plead. she had impressed her teacher and her class. Maybe she'll get some house points. She was glad she googled the Mayans and also was glad that she didnt doubt her self and become so shy she couldn't speak!
